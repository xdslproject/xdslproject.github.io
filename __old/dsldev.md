In xDSL we are developing a Python toolbox for MLIR which will enable easy integration of MLIR with Python-based DSLs. Consequently, whilst DSL infrastructures have been traditionally highly siloed, using xDSL such developers can view their DSL as a front-end on-top of MLIR and LLVM, with xDSL facilitating this arrangement. The benefit for DSL developers is that this significantly lowers the barrier to entry for developing and maintaining a DSL, as well as providing a wealth of supporting tools for their users which are already integrated with MLIR.

## xDSL Python toolkit

The xDSL toolkit is available as the [PyPi xdsl package](https://pypi.org/project/xdsl/) with source code in the [xdsl GitHub repository](https://github.com/xdslproject/xdsl)
