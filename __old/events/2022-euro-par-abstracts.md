__Keynote: Evolutionary Re-Engineering of an Industrial HPC application with OP2__

The rapid evolution of High Performance Computing architectures has resulted in highly complex systems with massively parallel heterogeneous processors, deep and multiple memory hierarchies and interconnects. As a result, maintaining performance as platforms change has becomes increasingly difficult. On the one hand, open standards have been slow to catch up with supporting new hardware, and for many real applications have not provided the best performance achievable from these systems. On the other hand, proprietary solutions have only targeted narrow vendor-specific devices resulting in a proliferation of parallel programming models and technologies. In this talk I will present how we used OP2, one of the earliest DSLs developed in the UK, to re-engineer the Hydra CFD application, a production HPC application from Rolls-Royce to achieve a performance portable code-base.  The recent use of the new application, OP2-Hydra, to carry out break-through simulations reaching fidelity levels for virtual certification of aero gas-turbine engine design will be presented. I will detail the simple source-to-source and automatic code-generation techniques based on maintainable software technologies led to these achievements enabling to evolve the application without overhauling or re-writing the entire code-base. The talk will discuss how OP2 has remained agile in delivering performance portability in the face of over a decade of hardware and parallel programming innovations and discuss lessons learnt from this work.

__Research paper: Performance of the Vipera framework for DSLs on micro-core architectures__

_Authors: Maurice Jamieson, Nick Brown_

Vipera provides a compiler and runtime framework for implementing dynamic Domain-Specific Languages on micro-core architectures. The performance and code size of the generated code is critical on these architectures. In this paper we present the results of our investigations into the efficiency of Vipera in terms of code performance and size.

__Research paper: FFTc: An MLIR Dialect for Developing HPC Fast Fourier Transform Libraries__

_Authors: Yifei He, Artur Podobas, MÃ¥ns Andersson and Stefano Markidis_

Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) libraries are one of the most critical software components for scientific computing. Inspired by FFTW, a widely used library for DFT HPC calculations, we apply compiler technologies for the development of HPC Fourier transform libraries. In this work, we introduce FFTc, a domain-specific language, based on Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR), for expressing Fourier Transform algorithms. We present the initial design, implementation, and preliminary results of FFTc.

__Invited talk: xDSL an ecosystem for DSL development__

Domain Specific Languages show great pootential for a range of domains, including HPC. However a major blocker has been that toolchains are siloed, sharing little or no infrastructure which not only increases development time but also raises questions around long term maintenance and support for future architectures. Recent advances in compiling tools, and the community at large, have resulted in Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) which promotes much easier reuse due to the ability to compose IR dialects together and to then rely on existing transformations which undertake optimisation and ultimately executable code via LLVM-IR or some other target. However, written in C++, there is a fairly steep learning curve in mastering and integrating MLIR, and-so the xDSL project are developing a Python toolbox which enables DSL developers to much more easily integrate with this technology, and define their own dialects and transformations in Python. Furthermore, by providing a rich set of existing dialects targetted at HPC, it is our objective that DSL developers can focus on their abstractions with the required implementation being a thin layer on-top of an existing, rich, ecosystem.

__Reseach paper: TensorFlow as a DSL for stencil-based computation on the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine__

_Authors: Nick Brown, Brandon Echols, Justs Zarins, Tobias Grosser_

The Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE) is an accelerator that combines hundreds of thousands of AI-cores onto a single chip. Whilst this technology has been designed for machine learning workloads, the significant amount of available raw compute means that it is also a very interesting potential target for accelerating traditional HPC computational codes. Many of these algorithms are stencil-based, where update operations involve contributions from neighbouring elements, and in this paper we explore the suitability of this technology for such codes from the perspective of an early adopter of the technology, compared to CPUs and GPUs. Using TensorFlow as the interface, we explore the performance and demonstrate that, whilst there is still work to be done around exposing the programming interface to users, performance of the WSE is impressive as it out performs four V100 GPUs by two and a half times and two Intel Xeon Platinum CPUs by around 114 times in our experiments. There is significant potential therefore for this technology to play an important role in accelerating HPC codes on future exascale supercomputers.
