subtitle: 27-31 January 2025

From January 28 to 31, as part of the DeepGreen project, we are participating in a Winter School on the MLIR compilation infrastructure in Paris (HÃ´tel Maison Montmartre). The program is available [here](https://sites.google.com/view/mlirwinterschoolparis2025/home).

In recent years, MLIR-based compilers have been widely adopted in both academia and industry. MLIR has become a de facto standard in many sectors and a shared compiler infrastructure, enabling new projects to build on sound and reliable existing solutions. This Winter School aims to facilitate the discovery and adoption of this growing, dynamic, and innovative software ecosystem.

The Winter School will be preceded by a one-day workshop at Google Paris headquarters on compiler infrastructures for Machine Learning. The program will include an introduction to MLIR concepts using xDSL.
