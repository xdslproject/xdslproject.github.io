ExCALIBUR is a UK research programme that aims to deliver the next generation of high-performance simulation software for the highest-priority fields in UK research. It started in October 2019 and will run through until March 2025, redesigning high priority computer codes and algorithms to meet the demands of both advancing technology and UK research. 

xDSL has been funded by ExCALIBUR and is one of the cross-cutting research theme projects. We are working closely with numerous other ExCALIBUR projects and targetting a number of the H&ES testbeds.
