Please join us at the [xDSL workshop](https://xdsl.dev/events/2025-HiPEAC/), on
Monday the 20th of January.

The talks will feature a general overview of xDSL, some success stories of xDSL
being used in HPC and ML workloads, and some experiments leveraging xDSL
infrastructure.

We look forward to seeing you there and discussing how xDSL can help you with
your projects!
