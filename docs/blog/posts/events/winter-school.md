From January 28 to 31, as part of the DeepGreen project, we are participating in
a Winter School on the MLIR compilation infrastructure in Paris (Hôtel Maison
Montmartre). The program is available
[here](https://sites.google.com/view/mlirwinterschoolparis2025/home).

In recent years, MLIR-based compilers have been widely adopted in both academia
and industry. MLIR has become a de facto standard in many sectors and a shared
compiler infrastructure, enabling new projects to build on sound and reliable
existing solutions. This Winter School aims to facilitate the discovery and
adoption of this growing, dynamic, and innovative software ecosystem.

The Winter School will be preceded by a one-day workshop at Google Paris
headquarters on compiler infrastructures for Machine Learning. The program will
include an introduction to MLIR concepts using xDSL.
